# Simple Parallax Lib
Hello! This is my take on creating a parallax effect script
for making websites more dynamic and fun to scroll through.
I have built it primarily for my online portfolio, but have
subsequently added more features that I didn't originally
intend to.
# What is this script capable of?
1. Standard parallax
2. Sideways movement (diagonally as well)
3. LERP parallax transforms
4. Start-Stop movement
# How to use?
Wisit this [page](https://krisdifire.github.io/parallax.html "Parallax") for a nice summary as well as
examples in action.
# Questions?
Either leave them here, or find my contact [here](https://krisdifire.github.io/ "Kris' portfolio").
I would love to hear how this script can be more optimized and improved upon.
#Cheers!
